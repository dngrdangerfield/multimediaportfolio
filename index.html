  <H2> Goal </H2>
  <h3> Create an interactive map of commuting times</H3>
    <H2>  The Story </H2> <p>
Bay Ridge residents may have a new commuting option in 2017 - a proposed inter-borough ferry service, announced at<a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/089-15/state-the-city-remarks-bill-de-blasio-prepared-delivery#/0" target="_blank"> would cost the same as a subway ride</a>,and quickly connect Southern Brooklyn residents to lower Manhattan.</p>
  <p> Time: 1 week (5 days) 
  </p>
  <p> Tears:0
    <p> Times said "After Effects was created by the Gods to punish us": 2 </p>

  <H2> Inspiration </H2>
 <p> The map was inspired by interactive map from <a href="http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/poverty-california/index.html"> Al Jazeera America's " In Between in California" </a> which explores people stuck between the poverty line and the middle class.</p>
 <p>  The original <a href=" http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/poverty-california/transportation.html"> interactive map </a> was created by the talented <a href=" https://twitter.com/lamthuyvo"> Lam Vo </a> who in addition to producing other fantastic work for Al Jazeera America was my interactive instructor at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism for Fall 2014. </p>

      <H2> Step Three </H2> <p> Once I was happy with the annimation timing it was off to Photoshop to export into a gif. </p>

      <p> Initially, I had my gif repeating forever-- but upon the suggestion of my professor I found code that allows you to stop and start a gif. </p>

    <div class="mini" id="mcenter"> <H2> Step Two</H2> <p>  

      I had to teach myself the basics of After Effects, which took alot longer than expected ( see above). I created masks for each of the commuting routes than timed them according to how long the commute took. 
      The clock that shows how long each commute took created from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ilCXXAQGA"> countdown tutorial</a>. </p>

      <p>I was unhappy about the look of the commuting routes, so  with the suggestion of my professor, I returned to Illustrator to redraw the routes and add a vector map of the Brooklyn and Manhattan for the background. </p></div>
    <div class="mini" id="mleft"> <H2> Step One </H2>
      <p> Currently, Bay Ridge Brooklyn has three commuting options - the R train, which runs local into Manhattan or two express busses. </p>
      <p> I took each route at peak commuting time and tracked my location by screenshotting my phone's GPS every minute. For the subway data, I tracked time and distance by using the MTA subway map. 
        <p> Using Open Map Data I plotted my commute times in Photoshop, then transfered my project to Illustrator to begin tracing the routes.  Because of the amount of data I collected, I elimiated data points that were extreamly close to one another ( traffic) or those that closer than five blocks).</p></div>
